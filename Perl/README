This script works off the DynECT API to do one of two primary actions:
1. Generate a two column CSV file where column 1 is a series of nodes withing a
zone and column 2 is the A Record located at that node
2. Update a zone by reading a 3 column zone extended from 1. whereas column 3 is
the new A record to replace the record listed to the left

OPTIONS:
-h/--help   Displays this help message
-f/--file   File to be read for updated record information
-z/--zone   Name of zone to be updated EG. example.com
-g/--gen    Set this option to generate a CSV file
With this option set -f will be used as the file to be written
With this option set -z will be used as the zone to be read

EXAMPLE USGAGE:
perl record_update.pl -f ips.csv -z example.com
-Read udpates from ips.csv and apply them to example.com

perl record_updates.pl -f gen.csv -z example.com --gen
-Read example.com and generate a CSV file from its current A records
