This script works off the DynECT API to do one of two primary actions:
1. Generate a CSV file with the followiing format:
fqdn, rtype, rdata, ttl
2. Update a zone by reading the csv whereas column 5-7 are in this format
newrtype, newrdata, ttl
-If column 2 is 'ADD' the script will add the record at that node
-If column 5 is 'DEL' the script will delete that a record
OPTIONS:
-h/--help		Displays this help message
-f/--file		File to be read for updated record information
-z/--zone		Name of zone to be updated EG. example.com
-g/--gen		Set this option to generate a CSV file
-d/--dryrun 	Set this run to interpret the CSV file and exit
				withouth publishing changes
-c/--confirm	Require confrimation before publishing changes
--noconfirm	Automatically publish changes without confrimaiton
With this option set -f will be used as the file to be written
With this option set -z will be used as the zone to be read

EXAMPLE USGAGE:
perl record_update.pl -f ips.csv -z example.com
-Read udpates from ips.csv and apply them to example.com

perl record_updates.pl -f gen.csv -z example.com --gen
